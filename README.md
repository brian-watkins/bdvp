## esbehavior

esbehavior is a framework for producing executable documentation. 

Use esbehavior to write *behaviors* that describe what your program does. 
Each behavior consists of one or more *examples* that together illustrate the behavior
you want to describe. Each example consists of some *conditions* and
some *effects*. esbehavior runs each example and generates a report that indicates which
example were valid and which were invalid.

See [the esbehavior subproject](./packages/esbehavior) for more info.
