## Behavior Documentation and Verification Program (BDVP)

BDVP is a framework for producing documentation that works. 

Use BDVP to write *documents* that describe the expected behaviors of your program. 
Each document consists of one or more *examples* that together illustrate the behavior
you want to describe. Each example consists of some *conditions* and
some *effects*. BDVP runs each example and generates a report that indicates which
example were valid and which were invalid.

See [the bdvp subproject](./packages/bdvp) for more info.

Check out the [architecture decision records](./adr) for info on development decisions.
